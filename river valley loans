If you have good or excellent credit and a steady, verifiable source of income, you may qualify for a personal loan with a competitive interest rate. To illustrate, online lender Upstart offers personal loans of up to $50,000 with interest rates as low as 6.70 percent.

Worried your credit score will keep you on the sideline and unable to qualify for a personal loan? As mentioned above, some online lenders cater to subprime borrowers. So, you may  pay a higher interest rate, but it still beats what youâ€™ll get with an online cash advance.

For example, borrowers with credit scores as low as 580 could be eligible for a personal loan from Avant. Loans of up to $35,000 are available, and the interest rate is capped at 35.99 percent.
