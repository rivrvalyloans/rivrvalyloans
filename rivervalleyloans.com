Several online lenders offer cash advances. To apply, you’ll visit the lender’s website, complete a brief application and await a lending decision. Be prepared to provide proof of income (i.e., your most recent pay stub) and your next pay date so the lender can set a due date for the loan to be repaid. The lender will also request your routing and checking account number belonging to the account where the funds should be sent.

You may have to agree to a hard credit check, but it’s not common with online cash advance lenders. Even if they check your credit and your score is on the lower end, you could still get approved for funding.

The lender will send the cash advance to your checking account if approved. When the due date rolls around, they will automatically withdraw the loan amount (including interest and fees) to collect what’s owed.
