The interest rates on cash advance loans are excessive due to the level of risk they pose to online lenders. Yet, consumers often turn to these debt products out of fear that they won’t have much luck elsewhere. The reality is some online lenders also feature subprime loans that come with higher rates but are still more affordable than what you’ll get with an online cash advance.

Furthermore, you’ll typically receive a loan term between one and five years. This greatly minimizes the likelihood of default as you’ll have much more time to repay what’s owed.

Some borrowers are attracted to cash advance loans over personal loans due to rapid funding times. However, many online lenders fund personal loans within one business day, and settling for a cash advance loan means you could get a much smaller loan than you need.
